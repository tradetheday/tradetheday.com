        <h3 class="card-title">A Flexible Form of Financial Trading</h3>
        <p>Spread betting is a derivative product that is tax-free (in permitted jurisdictions), which allows traders and investors to take advantage of price movements in stocks, Forex and other underlying financial assets.</p>
        
        <p>It's also known as a flexible form of trading because traders can bet on bearish and bullish price movements, taking short and long positions accordingly. This form of trading is also popular because an investor's profit-making opportunity is higher in comparison to other formats.</p>
        
        <div class="insight-box">
          <p>💡 <strong>Key Insight:</strong> You can take a position on both increasing or declining price movements. If you think the price will rise, you "go long" and create a BUY position. If you think it will decline, you "go short" and open a SELL position.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The profit generation depends only on the accuracy of your forecast and the size of your opening position. For instance, if you create a short position and the price declines, your spread bet is profitable. However, if the price movement works against you, your spread bet will be a losing one.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="content-card">
        <h3 class="card-title">What Is Spread?</h3>
        <p>The price you pay for opening a trade is known as spread. The spread is also known as the difference between the buy and sell prices.</p>
        
        <p>These buy and sell orders are usually known as bid (sell) and ask (buy). This means that the trader will sell slightly lower than the middle price of the asset and will buy a bit higher than the middle price of the underlying asset.</p>

        <p><strong>Key points for your due diligence:</strong></p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li><strong>Regulation:</strong> Check whether the broker is regulated by financial authorities before anything else</li>
          <li><strong>Trading Platform:</strong> Ensure they offer reliable platforms like MT4, MT5, or proprietary solutions</li>
          <li><strong>Asset Range:</strong> Look for brokers offering a wide range of investment opportunities for diversification</li>
          <li><strong>Fee Structure:</strong> Understand all costs including spreads, commissions, and any hidden charges</li>
          <li><strong>Payment Methods:</strong> Check available deposit and withdrawal methods that suit your needs</li>
          <li><strong>Demo Account:</strong> Essential for testing the platform and strategies risk-free</li>

        <div class="insight-box">
          <p>⚠️ <strong>Important:</strong> Fee structure is very important because several brokers impose hidden charges and commissions. Make sure the broker has a transparent and clear fee structure.</p>
