        <!-- Critical Warning -->
        <div class="callout callout-warning mb-lg">
          <h2 class="heading-3">⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING</h2>
          <p class="body">
            <strong>Trading derivatives and leveraged products carries a high level of risk, including the risk of losing substantially more than your initial investment.</strong> This is not suitable for all investors. You should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- General Risk Statement -->
        <div class="card mb-lg">
          <h2 class="heading-2">General Risk Statement</h2>
          <p class="body mb-md">
            Trading foreign exchange (forex), contracts for difference (CFDs), cryptocurrencies, spread betting, and other derivative products on margin carries significant risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage available can work against you as well as for you.
          </p>
          <p class="body">
            Before deciding to trade these products, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and potentially more than your deposited funds. Therefore, you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.
          </p>

        <!-- Specific Risk Factors -->
        <div class="card mb-lg">
          <h2 class="heading-2">Specific Risk Factors</h2>
          
          <h3 class="heading-3 mt-lg">Leverage Risk</h3>
          <p class="body mb-md">
            Leverage allows you to gain exposure to financial markets with a smaller initial capital outlay. However, leverage magnifies both profits and losses. A small adverse market movement can result in the loss of your entire deposit and you may be required to deposit additional funds to maintain your positions.
          </p>

          <h3 class="heading-3">Market Risk</h3>
          <p class="body mb-md">
            Financial markets can be highly volatile. Prices can shift rapidly and unpredictably due to various factors including economic announcements, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. There is no guarantee that strategies which have worked in the past will continue to be successful.
          </p>

          <h3 class="heading-3">Liquidity Risk</h3>
          <p class="body mb-md">
            Market conditions can change rapidly, resulting in difficulty executing trades at desired prices. During periods of low liquidity or high volatility, spreads may widen significantly, and you may be unable to close positions at expected prices.
          </p>

          <h3 class="heading-3">Counterparty Risk</h3>
          <p class="body mb-md">
            When trading OTC derivatives, you are exposed to the credit risk of your counterparty. If your broker becomes insolvent, you may lose some or all of your funds, even if held in segregated accounts.
          </p>

          <h3 class="heading-3">Technical Risk</h3>
          <p class="body mb-md">
            Trading platforms, internet connections, and other technical infrastructure can fail. You may experience losses due to system failures, connectivity issues, or delays in order execution.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Cryptocurrency Specific Risks -->
        <div class="card mb-lg">
          <h2 class="heading-2">Cryptocurrency-Specific Risks</h2>
          <ul class="list">

            <li><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> Cryptocurrencies face evolving and uncertain regulatory environments globally</li>
            <li><strong>Security Risk:</strong> Digital wallets and exchanges can be hacked, resulting in permanent loss of funds</li>
