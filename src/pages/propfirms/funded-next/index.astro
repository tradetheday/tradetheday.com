// FAQ data
const faqItems = [
  {
    question: 'Is Funded Next legitimate?',
    answer: 'Funded Next is a legitimate prop firm founded in 2022 and based in Dubai, UAE. Despite being newer than competitors, they have grown rapidly and processed millions in payouts. However, their short track record means more due diligence is recommended compared to established firms like FTMO.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you really earn during the Funded Next evaluation?',
    answer: 'Yes, Funded Next offers 15% profit share during the evaluation phase. This is unique in the industry - if you make $10,000 during evaluation, you receive $1,500 regardless of whether you pass. This helps offset challenge costs and rewards skill during the proving process.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the Funded Next profit split?',
    answer: 'Funded Next starts at 80% profit split and scales up to 95% - the highest in the industry. You reach 90% after your first scale, and 95% at maximum scale. This is 5% higher than most competitors offering 90% maximum.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does Funded Next scaling work?',
    answer: 'Funded Next offers scaling up to $4 million in maximum funding - the highest among major prop firms. Every 4 months with 10% profit, your account doubles. The profit split also increases: 80% → 85% → 90% → 95% as you scale.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does Funded Next have a time limit?',
    answer: 'No, Funded Next offers unlimited time on their evaluation. You can take as long as needed to hit the profit target without any deadline pressure. This is a significant advantage over FTMO (30 days) and other time-limited competitors.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the Funded Next Express model?',
    answer: 'The Express model is a one-phase evaluation (instead of two phases) with a higher profit target of 25%. It is designed for confident traders who want to get funded faster. You still get 15% profit share during the evaluation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How fast are Funded Next payouts?',
    answer: 'Funded Next processes payouts bi-weekly (every 14 days). Most withdrawals are processed within 24-48 hours after request. Payment methods include bank transfer, crypto, and various e-wallets.'

        <h4>Understanding Funded Next's Aggressive Value Proposition</h4>
        <p>Funded Next has taken every metric traders care about and pushed it further than anyone else. But with great rewards come questions about sustainability. Let's analyze what they offer and what it means.</p>

        <h5>The 15% Evaluation Profit Share</h5>
        <p>This is genuinely revolutionary. Traditional prop firms profit when traders fail challenges - you pay the fee, fail, and they keep the money. Funded Next's model aligns their interests with yours during evaluation. If you make money, they share it with you. This suggests they're confident in their trading infrastructure and believe in their traders.</p>

        <h5>The 95% Profit Split Reality</h5>
        <p>At 95% profit split, Funded Next keeps only 5% of your profits. On a $100K account making $10K monthly, you keep $9,500 versus $9,000 at 90% firms or $8,000 at 80% firms. Over a year, that's $6,000-$18,000 more in your pocket.</p>

        <h5>The Sustainability Question</h5>
        <p>Here's the honest concern: how sustainable is this model? Funded Next is newer (2022) and hasn't weathered market crashes or regulatory scrutiny. They're growing aggressively with industry-leading terms. Historically, some aggressive prop firms have collapsed (MyForexFunds) while others thrive. Time will tell which path Funded Next takes.</p>

        <h5>Our Recommendation</h5>
        <p>Funded Next offers objectively the best financial terms in prop trading. The risk is their 2-year track record versus FTMO's 9 years. If you're comfortable with newer firms, Funded Next maximizes your profit potential. If you prioritize safety over returns, consider splitting between Funded Next and more established firms.</p>

      <AnalystNotes
        title="Maximizing Value from Funded Next's Programs"
        icon="💡"
        id="challenge-notes"
        variant="dark"
      >
        <h4>Strategic Program Selection</h4>
        <p>The choice between Evaluation and Express depends on your trading style and confidence level. Here's how to decide.</p>

        <h5>Evaluation Model Analysis</h5>
        <p>The standard Evaluation is the better choice for 90% of traders. 10% target in Phase 1, 5% in Phase 2, unlimited time. Plus, you earn 15% of profits during evaluation. If you make 15% getting to funded status, you've already earned back your challenge fee in profit share.</p>

        <h5>Express Model Reality Check</h5>
        <p>25% profit target is aggressive. With 10% max drawdown, that's a 2.5:1 required profit-to-risk ratio. Most traders can't consistently achieve this. The lower starting profit split (60% vs 80%) also means you earn less initially. Only consider Express if you regularly achieve 15%+ monthly returns.</p>

        <h5>The 15% Eval Profit Math</h5>
        <p>On a $100K Evaluation challenge ($519 fee):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Phase 1: Make 12% ($12,000) to pass. You receive $1,800 (15%).</li>
          <li>Phase 2: Make 6% ($6,000) to pass. You receive $900 (15%).</li>
          <li>Total eval profit share: $2,700 - covering your $519 fee 5x over.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even if you fail, you might earn back part of your fee through profit sharing during the attempt.</p>

        <h5>Account Size Recommendation</h5>
        <p>Start with $50K-$100K accounts. The pricing is competitive, and the 15% eval profit share makes larger accounts even more valuable since you're earning real money while proving yourself.</p>

      <AnalystNotes
        title="Navigating Funded Next's Rule Structure"
        icon="🎓"
        id="rules-notes"
        variant="light"
      >
        <h4>The Flexible Rules Advantage</h4>
        <p>Funded Next's rules are among the most trader-friendly available. But the standard drawdown rules still require careful risk management.</p>

        <h5>The Unlimited Time Strategy</h5>
        <p>With no time pressure, you can afford to wait for perfect setups. Many traders at time-limited firms force trades in the final week. At Funded Next, you could wait three months for ideal market conditions, then trade aggressively. Patience becomes your edge.</p>

        <h5>Profit Share Optimization</h5>
        <p>Since you earn 15% during evaluation, there's incentive to extend your challenge if you're profitable. Instead of barely hitting 10%, consider aiming for 15-20% during Phase 1. You'll earn more profit share and prove stronger consistency for the funded phase.</p>

        <h5>The 5% Daily Drawdown Reality</h5>
        <p>Despite flexible rules elsewhere, the 5% daily drawdown remains strict. On a $100K account, that's $5,000 maximum daily loss. Position size accordingly:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Risk 1% per trade = 5 consecutive losses before daily limit</li>
          <li>Risk 2% per trade = 2.5 consecutive losses before limit</li>
          <li>Recommendation: Stay at 1% or below for safety margin</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Weekend Risk Management</h5>
        <p>Weekend holding is allowed, but gaps can be brutal. A 300-pip gap on Monday could breach your daily drawdown instantly. Consider closing or reducing positions before weekends if you're near drawdown limits.</p>

        id="payout-notes"
        variant="dark"
      >
        <h4>Maximizing Long-Term Earnings</h4>
        <p>Funded Next's payout structure is designed to reward consistency over time. Here's how to think about the financial opportunity.</p>

        <h5>The 95% Split Advantage</h5>
        <p>At maximum scale with 95% split on a $4M account making 3% monthly ($120K):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You keep: $114,000/month</li>
          <li>At 90% elsewhere: $108,000/month</li>
          <li>Annual difference: $72,000 more at Funded Next</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Realistic Scaling Timeline</h5>
        <p>The $4M maximum sounds impressive, but reaching it requires sustained excellence. At 10% per 4-month cycle, going from $100K to $4M takes roughly 6-7 scaling events over 24-28 months. Few traders achieve this. A more realistic goal is reaching $400K-$800K over 12-18 months.</p>

        <h5>Payout Reliability</h5>
        <p>Funded Next processes payouts bi-weekly, typically within 24-48 hours. They've maintained good payout consistency since launch. However, as a 2022 company, they lack the long track record of FTMO (9 years). Some traders split funds between firms to reduce single-firm risk.</p>

        <h5>The Evaluation Profit Share Value</h5>
        <p>Don't underestimate the 15% eval profit share. If you attempt three $100K challenges, making 15% each time before failing, that's $4,500 earned during evaluations - nearly covering all three challenge fees. You're compensated for skill even during the proving process.</p>

        <h4>MetaTrader Focus</h4>
        <p>Funded Next keeps it simple with MT4 and MT5. For most traders, this covers all needs. If you require cTrader, you'll need to look at FTMO or other firms.</p>

        <h5>Execution Quality</h5>
        <p>Funded Next uses reputable liquidity providers with competitive spreads. Execution is suitable for all trading styles including scalping. However, during high-impact news events, spreads can widen significantly - normal for all prop firms.</p>

        <h5>Expert Advisors</h5>
        <p>All EAs and automated trading are permitted. If you have a profitable algorithm, Funded Next's terms (95% split, $4M scaling) make it potentially the best home for EA traders among major prop firms.</p>

        <h5>Copy Trading</h5>
        <p>You can copy trades between your own accounts. Some traders use this to run multiple Funded Next accounts simultaneously. Be aware that each account's drawdown is calculated independently.</p>

        <h4>Where Funded Next Excels</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Financial Terms:</strong> 95% split and $4M max are industry-leading</li>
          <li><strong>Eval Profit Share:</strong> Unique 15% during evaluation - no one else offers this</li>
          <li><strong>Time Flexibility:</strong> Unlimited evaluation time</li>
          <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Competitive fees starting at $59</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Where Funded Next Falls Short</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Track Record:</strong> Only 2 years vs. FTMO's 9 years - significant risk consideration</li>
          <li><strong>Platform Options:</strong> MT4/MT5 only, no cTrader or proprietary platforms</li>
          <li><strong>Support:</strong> Rapid growth has strained customer support at times</li>
          <li><strong>Rule Complexity:</strong> Different models (Eval, Express) add decision complexity</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>The Core Trade-Off</h5>
        <p>Funded Next offers the best financial terms in the industry. The trade-off is trusting a newer company with your trading future. FTMO has proven they survive market crashes and regulatory scrutiny. Funded Next hasn't faced these tests yet.</p>

        <h5>Our Recommendation</h5>
        <p>For experienced prop traders comfortable with newer firms: Funded Next maximizes your profit potential. For first-time prop traders or those prioritizing security: consider <a href="/propfirms/ftmo">FTMO</a> for reliability, or split between Funded Next and an established firm to balance risk and reward.</p>

        <h4>The Bottom Line on Funded Next</h4>
        <p>Funded Next earns 4.3/5 - strong marks for financial terms, slightly tempered by their newer status. They've built the most trader-favorable prop firm offering available today.</p>

        <h5>The Bull Case</h5>
        <p>If Funded Next maintains their current trajectory, they could become the dominant prop firm within 3-5 years. Their terms are so favorable that traders who trust them benefit significantly. The 15% eval profit share alone is worth the risk for many traders.</p>

        <h5>The Bear Case</h5>
        <p>Prop firm history includes collapses (MyForexFunds, others). Funded Next is growing aggressively with industry-best terms - a model that requires significant capital reserves and operational excellence. If the company faces challenges, traders could be affected.</p>

        <h5>Our Recommendation</h5>
        <p>For experienced traders: Funded Next is hard to beat on pure financial terms. Consider making them your primary prop firm while maintaining funded accounts elsewhere as backup.</p>
        <p>For newer traders: Start with <a href="/propfirms/ftmo">FTMO</a> for the security of their track record. Once comfortable with prop trading, consider adding Funded Next accounts for the superior profit split.</p>
        <p>For all traders: Never have more capital at risk with any single prop firm than you can afford to lose. Diversification applies to prop firms just like investments.</p>
