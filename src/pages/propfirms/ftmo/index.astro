// FAQ data
const faqItems = [
  {
    question: 'Is FTMO legitimate?',
    answer: 'Yes, FTMO is one of the most legitimate and trusted prop firms in the industry. Founded in 2015 in Prague, Czech Republic, they have paid out over $200 million to traders worldwide. They are registered as a legal entity and have built a strong reputation over 9+ years of operation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the FTMO Challenge work?',
    answer: 'The FTMO Challenge is a two-phase evaluation. In Phase 1, you must reach a 10% profit target within 30 days while staying within the 10% maximum drawdown and 5% daily drawdown limits. Phase 2 (Verification) requires a 5% profit target in 60 days with the same risk rules. Pass both, and you become a funded FTMO Trader.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the FTMO profit split?',
    answer: 'FTMO offers an 80% profit split to start, meaning you keep 80% of all profits you make. Through their scaling plan, this can increase to 90% as you prove consistent profitability. The remaining portion goes to FTMO for providing the capital and infrastructure.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I hold trades over the weekend with FTMO?',
    answer: 'Yes, FTMO allows weekend holding. However, be aware that gaps can occur when markets reopen, which could impact your drawdown. Many traders close positions before weekends to avoid this risk, but it is your choice as a funded trader.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if I fail the FTMO Challenge?',
    answer: 'If you fail by hitting the maximum drawdown or daily drawdown limit, you lose the challenge and the fee paid. However, FTMO offers a Free Retry if you hit the profit target but fail due to other reasons. You can also purchase a new challenge at any time with no waiting period.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How fast are FTMO payouts?',
    answer: 'FTMO processes payouts bi-weekly (every 14 days) after your first month as a funded trader. Most payouts are processed within 1-3 business days via bank transfer, Skrill, or crypto. FTMO has an excellent track record for reliable, on-time payouts.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is news trading allowed on FTMO?',
    answer: 'Yes, news trading is allowed on FTMO accounts. However, you must be mindful of the 5% daily drawdown rule, as high-impact news events can cause rapid price movements. Many traders avoid trading directly before major announcements to manage this risk.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the FTMO discount code?',
    answer: `Use code ${firm.discountCode?.code || 'TRADETHEDAY'} at checkout to receive 10% off your FTMO Challenge fee. This code works on all account sizes from $10K to $200K, saving you between $15 and $108 depending on your chosen account size.`

        title="Why FTMO Dominates the Prop Firm Industry"
        icon="🎯"
        id="overview-notes"
        variant="light"
      >
        <h4>The FTMO Advantage Explained</h4>
        <p>Having analyzed dozens of prop firms over the years, FTMO consistently stands out for one simple reason: they actually pay traders. While competitors have come and gone (RIP MyForexFunds), FTMO has maintained an impeccable track record since 2015.</p>

        <h5>Trust Is Everything in Prop Trading</h5>
        <p>The prop firm industry has a dark side. Many firms are designed to profit from failed challenges, not from funding successful traders. They make rules intentionally difficult, slow-play payouts, or simply disappear with trader funds. FTMO operates differently - their business model depends on funded traders succeeding because they take a cut of profits, not challenge fees.</p>

        <h5>The $200M Payout Milestone</h5>
        <p>FTMO publicly tracks their total payouts - now exceeding $200 million. This isn't marketing fluff; it's verifiable through their published statistics and the thousands of trader testimonials. No other prop firm comes close to this track record. When you pass an FTMO challenge, you know you'll get paid.</p>

        <h5>Real Infrastructure, Real Support</h5>
        <p>FTMO operates from physical offices in Prague with over 100 employees. They have real customer support (responsive within hours, not days), a performance coach for struggling traders, and psychological coaching services. This isn't a fly-by-night operation - it's a legitimate financial services company that happens to fund retail traders.</p>

        <h5>The Challenge Fee Reality</h5>
        <p>Yes, FTMO is more expensive than some competitors. A $100K challenge costs $540 versus $300-400 elsewhere. But consider: would you rather pay $540 with near-certainty of payout, or $300 with uncertainty? The extra cost is insurance against prop firm risk - and in this industry, that insurance is worth every penny.</p>

        title="Which Account Size Should You Choose?"
        icon="💡"
        id="challenge-notes"
        variant="dark"
      >
        <h4>Account Size Strategy</h4>
        <p>The account size you choose should match your trading capital and risk tolerance - not your ego. Here's how to think about it strategically.</p>

        <h5>The Math Behind Account Selection</h5>
        <p>Consider this: a $10K account challenge costs $155. If you pass, you need to make $1,000 (10%) on Phase 1, then $500 (5%) on Phase 2. As a funded trader, you'll keep 80% of profits. To recover your $155 challenge fee, you need to make $194 in profit - just 0.19% of the account.</p>

        <p>For a $100K account ($540 fee), you need $675 profit to break even - 0.068% of the account. Larger accounts are mathematically more capital-efficient if you can afford the challenge fee.</p>

        <h5>Risk Management Consideration</h5>
        <p>With a 5% daily drawdown limit on a $100K account, that's $5,000 maximum daily loss. If your typical trade risks 1%, you can take 5 simultaneous losing trades before hitting the daily limit. On a $10K account, that's only $500 - one bad trade with inappropriate position sizing ends your challenge.</p>

        <h5>Our Recommendation</h5>
        <p>Start with the $25K-$50K range if you're new to prop trading. It's large enough to trade comfortably with proper position sizing but small enough that the challenge fee doesn't create psychological pressure. Once funded, prove yourself, then scale through FTMO's program rather than buying a larger challenge upfront.</p>

          <p>Your account equity can never drop more than 10% below your initial balance. On a $100K account, if equity reaches $90,000, you're immediately disqualified. This is calculated on a trailing basis during the challenge.</p>

      <AnalystNotes
        title="Mastering the 5% Daily Drawdown Rule"
        icon="🎓"
        id="rules-notes"
        variant="light"
      >
        <h4>The Rule That Fails Most Traders</h4>
        <p>The 5% daily drawdown is the number one reason traders fail FTMO challenges. Understanding exactly how it works is essential for survival.</p>

        <h5>How Daily Drawdown Is Calculated</h5>
        <p>At 5 PM CE(S)T each day, FTMO records your account balance (not equity). Your daily drawdown limit for the next 24 hours is 5% below this value. Example: if your balance is $100,000 at 5 PM, your maximum equity cannot drop below $95,000 until the next reset.</p>

        <p><strong>Critical detail:</strong> This includes both realized losses AND unrealized floating losses. An open trade showing -$5,000 floating loss triggers the same breach as a closed -$5,000 loss.</p>

        <h5>The Compounding Trap</h5>
        <p>If you lose money, your daily limit effectively tightens. Start at $100K, lose $3K, end day at $97K. Tomorrow's limit is now $4,850 (5% of $97K), not $5,000. Consecutive losing days quickly compress your available risk.</p>

        <h5>Strategies to Stay Safe</h5>
        <p><strong>Position sizing:</strong> Never risk more than 1% per trade. This gives you 5 consecutive full losses before hitting the daily limit.</p>
        <p><strong>Stop loss discipline:</strong> Always use stop losses. A runaway trade during news or overnight can breach your daily limit before you wake up.</p>
        <p><strong>Time awareness:</strong> Know when the daily reset occurs (5 PM CE(S)T). If you're close to the limit, consider closing positions before reset to start fresh.</p>
        <p><strong>No averaging down:</strong> Adding to losing positions is the fastest way to breach daily drawdown. Cut losses early instead.</p>

        <h4>How to Grow to $400K and 90% Profit Split</h4>
        <p>FTMO's scaling plan rewards consistent profitability. Here's exactly how to maximize your funded account over time.</p>

        <h5>Scaling Requirements</h5>
        <p>To scale your account, you must achieve a 10% profit over a 4-month period while maintaining profitability for at least 2 of those months. When you meet these criteria, your account doubles in size (up to the $400K maximum).</p>

        <h5>Profit Split Progression</h5>
        <p>Your profit split increases alongside account scaling:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Initial:</strong> 80% profit split</li>
          <li><strong>First scale:</strong> 85% profit split</li>
          <li><strong>Second scale:</strong> 90% profit split (maximum)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Real Example</h5>
        <p>Start with a $100K account at 80% split. Over 4 months, make 12% profit ($12,000). You keep $9,600 (80%). After scaling: $200K account at 85% split. Same 12% performance now yields $24,000 profit, you keep $20,400. After second scale: $400K at 90% - 12% is $48,000, you keep $43,200.</p>

        <h5>The Long Game</h5>
        <p>Many traders rush to maximize profits in month one, blow the account, and restart. The smarter approach: treat the first year as account-building. Consistent 2-3% monthly returns compound into significant scaling. A $100K account at 90% split making 3%/month is $32,400/year in take-home - from a $540 initial investment.</p>

        <h4>Choosing the Right Platform</h4>
        <p>The platform you choose affects execution speed, available tools, and your overall trading experience. Here's how to decide.</p>

        <h5>MetaTrader 4 - The Industry Standard</h5>
        <p>MT4 remains the most popular choice for forex traders. Massive community, thousands of free indicators and EAs, proven reliability. If you're running automated strategies (Expert Advisors), MT4 has the deepest ecosystem. Limitation: can't trade stocks or newer crypto pairs.</p>

        <h5>MetaTrader 5 - The Modern Choice</h5>
        <p>MT5 offers more timeframes, better backtesting, and access to more instruments including stocks. The MQL5 language is more powerful than MQL4. Downside: less third-party resources than MT4, and some MT4 indicators/EAs don't work on MT5.</p>

        <h5>cTrader - For Serious Scalpers</h5>
        <p>cTrader offers superior order execution and a cleaner interface than MetaTrader. Level II pricing, detachable charts, and better native copy trading features. If you're a scalper or discretionary trader who doesn't rely on MT4 indicators, cTrader is arguably the better platform.</p>

        <h5>DXtrade - The Newcomer</h5>
        <p>FTMO's newest platform option. Browser-based, no download required. Good for traders who switch between devices or prefer not to install software. Less feature-rich than MT4/MT5/cTrader but adequate for most trading needs.</p>

        <h5>Our Recommendation</h5>
        <p>If you're already comfortable with a platform, stick with it. The learning curve of switching platforms during a challenge isn't worth it. For new traders: start with MT4 for the community support, or cTrader for the superior user experience.</p>

        <h4>The Prop Firm Landscape in 2026</h4>
        <p>The prop firm industry has experienced significant turmoil. Understanding what happened helps explain why FTMO remains our top recommendation.</p>

        <h5>The MyForexFunds Collapse</h5>
        <p>In August 2023, MyForexFunds was shut down by the CFTC and NFA, freezing millions in trader funds. The firm was accused of operating as an illegal derivatives exchange and misleading traders about how their business operated. This wasn't an isolated incident - several other prop firms have collapsed or significantly restricted payouts.</p>

        <h5>Why FTMO Is Different</h5>
        <p>FTMO operates from the Czech Republic under EU regulations. They're transparent about their business model, maintain physical offices, and have a 9-year track record of consistent payouts. When the industry faced scrutiny, FTMO's operations continued without interruption.</p>

        <h5>The Price Premium Justified</h5>
        <p>Yes, FTMO charges more than competitors like The Funded Trader or E8 Funding. But consider the value proposition: near-certainty of payout vs. risk of firm closure. The $100-200 premium per challenge is effectively insurance against losing everything. Given the industry's history, that's insurance worth buying.</p>

        <h5>When Alternatives Make Sense</h5>
        <p>If you're experienced, have passed multiple challenges elsewhere, and understand the risks - cheaper alternatives might suit you. The Funded Trader offers good value with a reasonable track record. But for first-time prop traders or those who value peace of mind, FTMO's premium is worth paying.</p>

        <h4>The Bottom Line</h4>
        <p>We've reviewed every major prop firm in the industry. FTMO consistently comes out on top for one simple reason: they do what they promise. When you pass the challenge, you get funded. When you make profits, you get paid. When you have problems, support responds.</p>

        <h5>Who Should Use FTMO</h5>
        <p>FTMO is ideal for traders who have a proven strategy with consistent results. If you can make 1-2% per month reliably with proper risk management, FTMO will reward you with significant capital to trade. The challenge weeds out gamblers - as it should.</p>

        <h5>Who Should Look Elsewhere</h5>
        <p>If you're still learning, haven't traded profitably on a demo account, or tend to overtrade/revenge trade - you're not ready for FTMO. The challenge fee is non-refundable, and blowing challenges repeatedly gets expensive. Get consistently profitable first, then apply.</p>

        <h5>The Investment Perspective</h5>
        <p>A $540 FTMO challenge for a $100K account is one of the best risk/reward investments in trading. Pass rate industry-wide is around 10-15%, but traders with solid systems see 30-40% pass rates. Even at 30%, your expected value is strongly positive given the potential returns of a funded account.</p>

        <p>Use our exclusive code <strong>{firm.discountCode?.code || 'TRADETHEDAY'}</strong> for 10% off your challenge and start your funded trading journey with the industry's most trusted prop firm.</p>
