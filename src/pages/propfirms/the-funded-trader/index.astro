  },
  {
    question: 'What is the TFT profit split?',

    question: 'What makes TFT different from FTMO?',
    answer: 'TFT offers lower prices ($65 starting vs $155), higher max funding ($600K vs $400K), and more challenge types including Rapid and Knight challenges. However, FTMO has a longer track record and more reliable payout history.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the TFT Knight Challenge?',
    answer: 'The Knight Challenge is TFT\'s aggressive option with higher profit targets but also higher potential rewards. It\'s designed for confident traders willing to take on more demanding requirements for faster funding.'

        The Funded Trader (TFT) is a US-based prop firm founded in 2021 that has quickly become one of the most popular
        alternatives to FTMO. Known for competitive pricing, flexible rules, and multiple challenge types, TFT offers
        funding up to $600,000 - the highest in the industry.

        variant="light"
      >
        <h4>Understanding TFT's Position in the Market</h4>
        <p>The Funded Trader occupies an interesting position: they offer better pricing and higher funding limits than FTMO, but with less track record. Here's how to think about this trade-off.</p>

        <h5>The Value Proposition</h5>
        <p>TFT's $50K challenge costs $299 versus FTMO's $345 - a $46 saving. Their $200K challenge is $949 versus FTMO's $1,080 - a $131 difference. For traders taking multiple challenges, these savings compound. Plus, TFT's $600K max funding exceeds FTMO's $400K cap.</p>

        <h5>The Trust Consideration</h5>
        <p>Founded in 2021, TFT has roughly 3 years of history versus FTMO's 9+ years. They've paid out over $50M to traders - impressive, but less than FTMO's $200M+. Some traders have reported payout delays, though most eventually receive their funds. The company hasn't faced regulatory action, but hasn't been tested through major industry turmoil either.</p>

        <h5>Who Should Choose TFT Over FTMO</h5>
        <p>TFT makes sense if you're (1) budget-conscious and the lower fees meaningfully impact your decisions, (2) targeting funding above $400K where FTMO caps out, (3) want specific challenge types like Rapid or Knight that FTMO doesn't offer, or (4) comfortable with slightly higher counterparty risk for cost savings.</p>

        <h5>Who Should Stick With FTMO</h5>
        <p>Choose FTMO if you prioritize reliability over price, this is your first prop firm experience, or you're funding a trading business where payout certainty matters more than a few hundred dollars in fees.</p>

        title="Which TFT Challenge Should You Choose?"
        icon="🎯"
        id="challenge-notes"
        variant="dark"
      >
        <h4>Challenge Selection Strategy</h4>
        <p>Different challenge types suit different trading personalities. Here's how to decide.</p>

        <h5>Standard Challenge: The Safe Choice</h5>
        <p>If you're unsure, go Standard. The two-phase structure gives you more time and lower Phase 2 targets. You get 35 days for 10%, then 60 days for 5% - that's nearly 100 days total to prove yourself. The rules are familiar to anyone who's studied prop firms.</p>

        <h5>Rapid Challenge: For the Impatient</h5>
        <p>One phase means faster funding if you pass. But the tighter drawdown (5% max vs 10%) leaves less room for error. Good for traders with proven systems who don't need extended evaluation periods. Bad for anyone who might need time to adjust to prop firm psychology.</p>

        <h5>Knight Challenge: High Risk, High Reward</h5>
        <p>The 12% target is demanding - that's 12% profit with the same drawdown limits as Standard. Only choose this if your backtested strategy regularly produces 3%+ monthly returns with controlled drawdowns. The failure rate is higher, but successful traders get better terms.</p>

        <h5>Account Size Recommendation</h5>
        <p>TFT's sweet spot is the $50K Standard Challenge at $299. It's large enough to trade comfortably, priced reasonably, and positions you well for scaling to their $600K maximum. The $5K challenge ($65) is cheap but limits your position sizing significantly.</p>

        title="TFT Rules: More Flexible Than You Think"
        icon="📋"
        id="rules-notes"
        variant="light"
      >
        <h4>What Sets TFT's Rules Apart</h4>
        <p>While the core drawdown rules match industry standards, TFT offers more flexibility in how you trade.</p>

        <h5>News Trading Advantage</h5>
        <p>Many prop firms restrict trading within 2-5 minutes of high-impact news. TFT doesn't. This matters for news traders who specifically target NFP, rate decisions, or employment data. Just remember: more flexibility means more rope to hang yourself. The 5% daily drawdown doesn't care whether you lost it on news or not.</p>

        <h5>The 5 Trading Days Requirement</h5>
        <p>TFT requires 5 minimum trading days versus FTMO's 4. This prevents pure "one big trade" approaches and encourages consistent behavior. For most traders, this is irrelevant - you'll trade more than 5 days anyway. But if you're a position trader making only a few trades per month, factor this in.</p>

        <h5>EA and Copy Trading Allowance</h5>
        <p>TFT permits Expert Advisors and copy trading services, though they monitor for specific prohibited strategies like arbitrage or latency exploitation. If your EA is a legitimate trading system rather than an exploit, you're fine. Check their current terms for specific copy trading provider guidelines.</p>

        <h5>Rule Enforcement</h5>
        <p>TFT uses automated systems for drawdown monitoring - breaches are immediate and non-negotiable. They're less likely to offer discretionary "good faith" exceptions compared to FTMO. Know the rules exactly and stay well within limits rather than pushing edges.</p>

        <h4>What to Expect From TFT Payouts</h4>
        <p>TFT has paid over $50M to traders, but their payout experience isn't always smooth. Here's the honest picture.</p>

        <h5>The Good</h5>
        <p>Most traders receive payouts within 1-5 business days of processing. The bi-weekly cycle is reliable. Crypto payouts tend to be faster than bank transfers. The profit split structure (80% → 90%) matches industry standards.</p>

        <h5>The Not-So-Good</h5>
        <p>During busy periods, some traders report delays of 1-2 weeks beyond normal processing times. Customer support during payout issues can be slow to respond. There have been occasional complaints about payout request rejections that required escalation to resolve.</p>

        <h5>Mitigation Strategies</h5>
        <p>Keep records of all your trading and payout requests. Use crypto withdrawals if speed matters - they're consistently faster. Don't rely on a specific payout date for expenses. Join TFT's Discord community where payout issues get more attention.</p>

        <h5>Scaling to $600K</h5>
        <p>TFT's scaling program can take you from a $50K account to $600K - the highest in the industry. Requirements involve consistent profitability over multiple months. At $600K with 90% split, a 3% monthly return is $16,200 take-home. That's life-changing income from a $299 initial challenge fee.</p>

        <h4>Platform Recommendations</h4>
        <p>Your platform choice should match your trading style and technical requirements.</p>

        <h5>MetaTrader 4: Best for Forex Focus</h5>
        <p>If you're primarily trading forex pairs with established indicators or EAs, MT4 remains the most reliable choice. Massive community support, proven stability, and universal familiarity. Most TFT traders use MT4.</p>

        <h5>MetaTrader 5: For Multi-Asset Traders</h5>
        <p>If you want to trade TFT's full instrument range including indices and crypto CFDs with more advanced features, MT5 is the better choice. More timeframes, better strategy tester, and access to more markets.</p>

        <h5>cTrader: The Scalper's Choice</h5>
        <p>cTrader offers superior execution speed and a cleaner interface. If you're a discretionary scalper who values quick order execution over EA capability, cTrader is worth considering. Less third-party indicator support than MT4/5 though.</p>

        <h5>Execution Quality Note</h5>
        <p>TFT uses specific liquidity providers for each platform. Execution quality can vary - some traders report better fills on MT4 vs cTrader or vice versa. If execution is critical to your strategy, test on demo first before committing to a challenge.</p>

        <h4>Who Should Use The Funded Trader</h4>
        <p>TFT is right for you if price sensitivity matters, you're targeting funding above $400K, you want news trading flexibility, or you're okay with slightly less proven payout reliability in exchange for better terms.</p>

        <h5>Who Should Choose Elsewhere</h5>
        <p>If this is your first prop firm experience, if you need absolute certainty on payouts, or if you're building a trading business where reliability trumps cost - FTMO remains the safer choice despite higher fees.</p>

        <h5>The Bottom Line</h5>
        <p>The Funded Trader has earned its place as the #2 prop firm in the industry. They're not FTMO, but they don't charge FTMO prices either. For traders who understand the trade-offs, TFT offers genuinely good value. Just go in with realistic expectations about payout timing and support quality.</p>
