// FAQs
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How much money do I need to start day trading?",
    answer: "You can start with as little as $100 at most forex brokers. However, $1,000-5,000 gives you more flexibility for proper position sizing and risk management. In the US, the Pattern Day Trader rule requires $25,000 minimum for stocks."
  },
  {
    question: "Is day trading profitable?",
    answer: "Most retail day traders lose money, with studies showing 70-90% are unprofitable. However, those who treat it as a serious profession, develop proper skills, and manage risk carefully can achieve consistent profits. Success requires education, practice, and discipline."
  },
  {
    question: "How many hours per day do day traders work?",
    answer: "Active trading typically takes 2-4 hours during peak market sessions. Add 1-2 hours for preparation, research, and journaling. Most successful day traders focus on specific time windows rather than watching screens all day."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the best market for day trading beginners?",
    answer: "Forex pairs like EUR/USD offer tight spreads, high liquidity, and 24/5 access. Start with major pairs before moving to volatile crosses. Stock indices like S&P 500 CFDs are also beginner-friendly with clear trends."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I quit my job to day trade?",
    answer: "No, not until you're consistently profitable for at least 6-12 months while trading part-time. Keep your income stream while learning. Many successful day traders started by trading the first hour before work or during lunch breaks."
