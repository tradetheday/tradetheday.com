  },
  {
    question: "Should I buy actual Bitcoin or trade CFDs?",
    answer: "It depends on your goals. Buy actual Bitcoin if you want to hold long-term (years) and control your own coins. Use CFDs if you want to trade short-term, use leverage, or short Bitcoin. Many traders do both."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Bitcoin too expensive to buy?",
    answer: "No. Bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places. You can buy 0.001 BTC ($50-100) or even less. You don't need to buy a whole Bitcoin."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the best time to trade Bitcoin?",
    answer: "Bitcoin trades 24/7, but highest volatility typically occurs when US markets open (9:30 AM ET), during Asian session opens, and around major news events. Weekend trading tends to have lower liquidity."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I store Bitcoin safely?",
    answer: "For trading, keep BTC on reputable exchanges. For long-term holding, use a hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor) or reputable software wallet. Never share your private keys or seed phrase with anyone."
  },
  {
    question: "What leverage should I use for Bitcoin?",
    answer: "Beginners should use no leverage or maximum 2-3x. Bitcoin's natural volatility (5-10% daily moves) means leverage can quickly wipe out your account. Professional traders rarely exceed 5-10x."

        <h3 class="card-title">The Bitcoin Halving Cycle</h3>
        <p>Every ~4 years, Bitcoin's block reward is cut in half (the "halving"). This predictable supply shock has historically triggered massive bull runs:</p>

        <ul class="content-list">
          <li><strong>2012 Halving:</strong> BTC went from $12 to $1,100 (+9,000%)</li>
          <li><strong>2016 Halving:</strong> BTC went from $650 to $20,000 (+3,000%)</li>
          <li><strong>2020 Halving:</strong> BTC went from $8,500 to $69,000 (+700%)</li>
          <li><strong>2024 Halving:</strong> Bull run likely through 2025-2026</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="insight-box">
          <p>📊 <strong>Pattern:</strong> Bitcoin typically peaks 12-18 months after each halving. Understanding this cycle is key to timing entries and exits.</p>

      <div class="content-card">
        <h3 class="card-title">Best Indicators for Bitcoin</h3>
        <p><strong>1. RSI (Relative Strength Index)</strong><br>
        Monthly RSI above 90 signals euphoria and potential tops. RSI below 30 signals capitulation and potential bottoms.</p>

        <p><strong>2. 200-Week Moving Average</strong><br>
        Bitcoin has never closed below the 200-week MA for long. It's the ultimate "buy the dip" indicator for long-term investors.</p>
