// FAQs
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Is cryptocurrency trading legal?",
    answer: "Yes, cryptocurrency trading is legal in most countries including the US, UK, Australia, and EU. However, regulations vary by jurisdiction. Always use regulated platforms and check your local laws regarding taxation."
  },
  {
    question: "How much money do I need to start trading crypto?",
    answer: "You can start with as little as $10 on most exchanges. For CFD trading, brokers typically require $50-200 minimum. We recommend starting with $500-1,000 for proper risk management."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between exchanges and CFD brokers?",
    answer: "Exchanges let you buy and own real cryptocurrency that you can transfer to wallets. CFD brokers let you speculate on price movements with leverage, but you never own the underlying coins. CFDs are better for short-term trading; exchanges for long-term holding."
  },
  {
    question: "Is crypto trading riskier than forex or stocks?",
    answer: "Yes, cryptocurrency is generally more volatile than traditional markets. Bitcoin can move 5-10% in a day, while forex pairs rarely move more than 1-2%. This means higher potential profits but also higher potential losses. Risk management is crucial."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the best cryptocurrency for beginners?",
    answer: "Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are the safest starting points. They have the most liquidity, longest track records, and widest acceptance. Avoid small-cap altcoins until you understand the market better."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I use leverage when trading crypto?",
    answer: "Beginners should avoid leverage or use very low leverage (2-5x maximum). Crypto is already volatile enough without amplifying losses. Professional traders rarely use more than 10x leverage on crypto."

        </p>

      <div class="content-card">
        <h3 class="card-title">1. HODLing (Buy and Hold)</h3>
        <p>The simplest strategy: buy Bitcoin or Ethereum and hold for months or years. Historically, holding Bitcoin for 4+ years has always been profitable regardless of entry point.</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Beginners, long-term investors, people who don't want to watch charts daily.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-card">
        <h3 class="card-title">2. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)</h3>
        <p>Invest a fixed amount at regular intervals (weekly, monthly) regardless of price. This removes emotion and timing risk from the equation.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Invest $100 every Monday into Bitcoin. Over time, you'll buy more when prices are low and less when high.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-card">
        <h3 class="card-title">3. Swing Trading</h3>
        <p>Hold positions for days to weeks, capturing medium-term price swings. Use technical analysis to identify trends and reversals.</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Traders who can check charts a few times per day but don't want to day trade.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-card">
        <h3 class="card-title">4. Day Trading</h3>
        <p>Open and close positions within the same day. Requires significant time commitment, fast decision-making, and strict risk management.</p>
        <div class="insight-box">
          <p>⚠️ <strong>Warning:</strong> Studies show 70-80% of day traders lose money. Master swing trading before attempting to day trade.</p>
