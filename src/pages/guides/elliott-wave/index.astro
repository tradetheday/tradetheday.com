// FAQs
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Is Elliott Wave Theory reliable?",
    answer: "Elliott Wave provides a framework for market structure, but it's subjective and open to interpretation. Two analysts can see different wave counts on the same chart. It works best combined with other analysis methods (Fibonacci, support/resistance). Don't rely on it exclusively."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know which wave I'm in?",
    answer: "This is the hardest part of Elliott Wave. Use the three rules to eliminate invalid counts. Look at volume, momentum divergence, and Fibonacci retracements for clues. Wave 3 has highest volume, Wave 5 often shows divergence. Practice identifying completed patterns before trading live."
  },
  {
    question: "What timeframe works best for Elliott Wave?",
    answer: "Elliott Wave is fractal, meaning patterns exist on all timeframes. Higher timeframes (Daily, Weekly) give clearer patterns but fewer trades. Lower timeframes (1H, 4H) have more noise. Start with 4H or Daily charts to learn, then zoom in for entries."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Elliott Wave for day trading?",
    answer: "Yes, but it's more challenging on lower timeframes due to increased noise. Day traders typically use Elliott Wave on 1H charts for structure, then drop to 15min or 5min for entries. Always align with higher timeframe wave counts."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need special software for Elliott Wave analysis?",
    answer: "No. Any charting platform with trend lines and Fibonacci tools works. TradingView has Elliott Wave drawing tools built-in. MetaTrader platforms have similar capabilities. The analysis is manual - there's no reliable automated wave counting software."

        <p>The basic structure consists of 5 waves in the direction of the main trend (impulse waves), followed by 3 waves against it (corrective waves). This 5-3 pattern repeats at every scale, from minute charts to multi-decade cycles.</p>
