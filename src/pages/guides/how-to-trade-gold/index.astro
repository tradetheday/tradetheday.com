  },
  {
    question: "What's the best time to trade gold?",
    answer: "Gold trades 24/5, but the best liquidity is during London (3 AM - 12 PM ET) and New York (8 AM - 5 PM ET) sessions. Major moves often happen at market opens and during news releases."
  },
  {
    question: "Should I trade gold CFDs or futures?",
    answer: "CFDs are better for beginners - lower capital requirements, no expiry dates, and smaller position sizes. Futures are for professionals who need the deepest liquidity and lowest costs."
  },
  {
    question: "What leverage should I use for gold?",
    answer: "Start with 1:10 or lower. Gold can move 1-2% daily, so high leverage is dangerous. Professional traders rarely use more than 1:20 even with stop losses."

        <h3 class="card-title">The Ultimate Safe Haven Asset</h3>
        <p>Gold isn't just another commodity – it's the ultimate store of value. When stocks crash, currencies collapse, or uncertainty rises, gold shines. Since 1971, gold has outperformed the S&P 500 during every major crisis.</p>
        
        <div class="insight-box">

        <p>Unlike stocks or bonds, gold has intrinsic value. It can't go bankrupt, doesn't depend on company performance, and has maintained purchasing power for millennia. One ounce of gold bought a quality suit in ancient Rome – and still does today.</p>

          Understanding these 4 key drivers will transform your gold trading results.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="content-card">
        <h3 class="card-title">1. Central Bank Policy</h3>
        <p>Central banks are the 800-pound gorillas of the gold market. When they buy, prices soar. When they sell, markets tumble. In 2022, central banks bought a record 1,136 tonnes – and gold rallied 20%.</p>
        <p><strong>What to watch:</strong> Monthly central bank gold reserve reports, especially from China, Russia, and India. Any shift from selling to buying (or vice versa) signals major moves ahead.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="content-card">
        <h3 class="card-title">2. US Dollar Strength</h3>
        <p>Gold and the dollar are locked in an inverse dance. When USD weakens, gold strengthens – and vice versa. This relationship creates predictable trading opportunities.</p>
        <p><strong>Trading tip:</strong> Watch DXY (Dollar Index) for early signals. If DXY breaks support, gold often rallies within 24-48 hours.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="content-card">
        <h3 class="card-title">3. Real Interest Rates</h3>
        <p>Gold pays no yield, so it competes with bonds. When real rates (interest minus inflation) turn negative, gold becomes attractive. The formula is simple: Negative real rates = Bullish gold.</p>
        <div class="insight-box">
          <p>📊 <strong>Historical Fact:</strong> Every time US real rates dropped below -2%, gold rallied at least 25% within 12 months.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="content-card">
        <h3 class="card-title">4. Geopolitical Risk</h3>
        <p>Wars, elections, banking crises – gold loves chaos. During the 2008 crisis, gold rallied 25%. COVID-19? Up 30%. Ukraine invasion? Instant 8% spike.</p>
        <p><strong>Key events that move gold:</strong></p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>Military conflicts (especially Middle East)</li>
          <li>Banking system stress</li>

      <div class="content-card">
        <h3 class="card-title">Key Support & Resistance Levels</h3>
        <p>Gold respects technical levels better than most assets. These psychological levels act as magnets:</p>
        
        <ul class="levels-list">
          {keyLevels.map((level) => (
            <li><strong>{level.level}:</strong> {level.type}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Pro Strategy:</strong> Place orders just above resistance (for breakouts) or just below support (for bounces). Gold often spikes through these levels before reversing.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="content-card">
        <h3 class="card-title">Best Indicators for Gold</h3>
        
        <p><strong>1. RSI (Relative Strength Index)</strong><br />
        Gold tends to reverse at extreme RSI readings. Below 30 = oversold bounce incoming. Above 70 = overbought correction likely.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Moving Averages</strong><br />
        The 50-day and 200-day MAs are crucial. Golden cross (50 above 200) signals bull market. Death cross signals bear market.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3. Bollinger Bands</strong><br />
        Gold often tags the upper/lower bands before reversing. Squeeze patterns (bands narrowing) precede big moves.</p>
        
        <div class="insight-box">
          <p>⚡ <strong>Quick Win:</strong> Combine RSI divergence with support/resistance for 70%+ win rate setups.</p>
