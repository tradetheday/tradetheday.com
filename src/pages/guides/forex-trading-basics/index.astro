// FAQs
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Is forex trading profitable?",
    answer: "Forex trading can be profitable, but most retail traders lose money. Studies show 70-80% of retail forex traders are unprofitable. Success requires education, discipline, proper risk management, and realistic expectations. Treat it as a skill that takes years to master, not a get-rich-quick scheme."
  },
  {
    question: "How much money do I need to start forex trading?",
    answer: "You can start with as little as $50-100 at most brokers using micro lots. However, $500-1,000 gives you more flexibility for proper position sizing. The key is starting small and only risking money you can afford to lose while you learn."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the best currency pair for beginners?",
    answer: "EUR/USD is the most popular choice for beginners. It has the tightest spreads, highest liquidity, and most predictable behavior. After mastering EUR/USD, many traders move to GBP/USD or USD/JPY."
  },
  {
    question: "Is forex trading legal?",
    answer: "Forex trading is legal in most countries, but regulations vary. In the US, brokers must be registered with the CFTC/NFA. In the UK, the FCA regulates forex brokers. Always trade with a broker regulated in your jurisdiction."
  },
  {
    question: "When is the best time to trade forex?",
    answer: "The London-New York overlap (8 AM - 12 PM ET) offers the highest liquidity and volatility for major pairs. For Asian pairs like USD/JPY, the Tokyo session (7 PM - 4 AM ET) is best. Avoid trading during low-liquidity periods like weekends and major holidays."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between forex and stocks?",
    answer: "Forex trades currencies in pairs (EUR/USD), operates 24/5, uses higher leverage, and has no central exchange. Stocks trade company shares, operate during market hours, typically use lower leverage, and trade on exchanges like NYSE. Forex generally has lower transaction costs and higher liquidity."
