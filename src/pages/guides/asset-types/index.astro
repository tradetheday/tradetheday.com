// FAQs
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is CFD trading?",
    answer: "CFD (Contract for Difference) trading lets you speculate on price movements without owning the underlying asset. You profit from the difference between opening and closing prices. CFDs offer leverage, allowing you to control larger positions with less capital, but this also increases risk."
  },
  {
    question: "Which asset type is best for beginners?",
    answer: "Major currency pairs like EUR/USD are often recommended for beginners due to their high liquidity, tight spreads, and predictable behavior. Avoid exotic pairs and highly volatile assets like cryptocurrencies until you gain experience."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I trade all these assets with one broker?",
    answer: "Many modern forex brokers offer multi-asset trading including currencies, commodities, stocks, indices, and cryptocurrencies. AvaTrade, eToro, and similar brokers provide access to thousands of instruments from a single account."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between trading forex and stocks?",
    answer: "Forex markets are open 24/5 with higher leverage and no central exchange. Stock trading happens during exchange hours with lower leverage but potential dividend income. Forex has higher liquidity and lower transaction costs."
  },
  {
    question: "Are commodities like gold good for hedging?",
    answer: "Yes, gold is considered the premier safe-haven asset. During market uncertainty, investors often move money into gold, driving prices up. Silver and other precious metals also serve as hedges against inflation and currency devaluation."
  },
  {
    question: "How do indices work as trading instruments?",
    answer: "When you trade an index, you're speculating on the collective performance of its component stocks. Index movements reflect market sentiment for that region or sector. Higher-weighted components have more influence on the index price."
