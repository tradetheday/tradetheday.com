  {
    question: 'Is KuCoin safe to use?',
    answer: 'Mixed. They got hacked for $285M in 2020 - recovered most of it and made users whole, which is better than most hacks go. But they\'re based in Seychelles with no real regulation. Use 2FA, set up withdrawal whitelists, and don\'t keep large amounts there long-term.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can US residents use KuCoin?',
    answer: 'Officially, no. KuCoin blocks US access in their terms of service. Some Americans use VPNs to get around this, but that\'s risky - if something goes wrong, you have no recourse. US traders are better off with Kraken or Coinbase.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What are KuCoin\'s trading fees?',
    answer: '0.1% for both maker and taker on spot. Hold KCS tokens to drop that to 0.08%. Futures are 0.02% maker, 0.06% taker. VIP tiers exist for high volume, but the base rate is already competitive.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is KCS and why should I hold it?',
    answer: 'KuCoin\'s native token. Holding it gets you 20% off trading fees. Hold 6+ KCS and you get daily bonuses from exchange revenue (small but free money). Also gets you into token sales early. The fee discount alone is worth it if you trade regularly.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does KuCoin require KYC verification?',
    answer: 'No, for basic trading. Without KYC you can withdraw up to 5 BTC daily but can\'t buy crypto with fiat. KYC unlocks higher limits (200+ BTC daily), fiat purchases, and P2P trading. You\'ll need ID and face verification.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do KuCoin trading bots work?',
    answer: 'They\'re built into the platform and free. Grid Bot buys low/sells high in a range. DCA Bot does dollar-cost averaging. Smart Rebalance keeps your portfolio at target allocations. No coding needed - you just set parameters and fund it.'

        <h4>The real deal with KuCoin</h4>
        <p>Here's the pitch: KuCoin lists coins before Binance or Coinbase touch them. If you want to buy something obscure, it's probably here. Whether that's good or bad depends on your risk tolerance.</p>

        <h5>Why people actually use it</h5>
        <p>700+ coins. Binance has 350-ish, Kraken around 200. That gap matters if you're hunting small-cap projects or want in early on new launches. The obvious downside: more obscure coins means more scams. We've seen coins on KuCoin that turned out to be rugs. Do your own research - seriously.</p>

        <h5>The fees are good</h5>
        <p>0.1% flat for spot trades. Same as Binance, cheaper than Kraken (0.16-0.26%) and way cheaper than Coinbase (0.4-0.6%). Hold their KCS token and fees drop to 0.08%. On a $10K trade, you're paying $8-10 instead of $40-60. That adds up.</p>

        <h5>The Seychelles thing</h5>
        <p>KuCoin is based in Seychelles, which is code for "no real regulation." Most offshore exchanges work this way. It means no government insurance if they go bust, no regulator to complain to. The 2020 hack proved the risk is real - $285M stolen. They recovered most of it and made users whole, which was impressive. But there was no guarantee they had to.</p>

        <h5>Should you use it?</h5>
        <p>If you're outside the US, want coins that aren't on major exchanges yet, don't mind offshore risk, and won't store your life savings there - yeah, it works. If you're in the US (technically against their terms), paranoid about security, or a beginner who needs hand-holding - look elsewhere.</p>

      >
        <h4>What you'll actually pay</h4>
        <p>KuCoin keeps it simple: 0.1% maker, 0.1% taker. No complex tiers to figure out.</p>

        <h5>The math</h5>
        <p>$10,000 trade = $10 in fees. Same trade on Kraken costs $16-26. On Coinbase, $40-60. If you're trading regularly, that gap matters.</p>

        <h5>The KCS angle</h5>
        <p>Their native token gives you 20% off fees if you pay in KCS. So 0.1% becomes 0.08%. Hold 6+ KCS and you also get daily bonuses from exchange revenue - basically a small dividend. Don't expect to get rich from it, but it's a nice perk.</p>

        <h5>VIP tiers exist</h5>
        <p>$50K+ monthly volume gets you VIP 1: 0.08%/0.09%. VIP 12 ($10B+ monthly - so, hedge funds) gets 0.005%/0.025%. Most people will never hit these. The base 0.1% is fine.</p>

        <h5>Watch out for</h5>
        <p>Credit card deposits charge 3-5% - just deposit crypto instead. Withdrawal fees depend on the coin. Futures funding rates add up if you hold positions. Check fees before you trade anything you're not familiar with.</p>

        <h4>Let's talk about the hack</h4>
        <p>September 2020: hackers drained $285M from KuCoin's hot wallets. One of the biggest exchange hacks ever. That's the bad news.</p>

        <h5>What happened next</h5>
        <p>KuCoin worked with other exchanges to freeze the stolen crypto, tracked down the attackers, and recovered about 84%. Users got made whole through their insurance fund. It was actually handled better than most exchange hacks. But still - they got hacked for $285M. That happened.</p>

        <h5>Since then</h5>
        <p>They've tightened up hot wallet security, reduced how much they keep in hot wallets, improved monitoring. No hacks since. But "we haven't been hacked since 2020" is a five-year track record. Kraken has been running since 2011 with zero hacks. Context matters.</p>

        <h5>The regulation question</h5>
        <p>There isn't any, really. Seychelles doesn't regulate crypto exchanges in any meaningful way. No deposit insurance. No regulator to complain to if something goes wrong. You're trusting KuCoin to do the right thing because they want to, not because anyone's making them. The 2020 response was good. The next incident might not be.</p>

        <h5>What we'd suggest</h5>
        <p>If you use KuCoin: turn on 2FA (obviously), set up a trading password, whitelist your withdrawal addresses. Don't keep serious money there. Withdraw profits to your own wallet. Treat it like a trading venue, not a bank account. The tools exist to stay reasonably safe - use them.</p>

        <h4>Bottom line on KuCoin</h4>
        <p>We've been going back and forth on this one. KuCoin does some things really well and other things... less well.</p>

        <h5>The good stuff</h5>
        <p>If you want coins that aren't on Coinbase yet, KuCoin probably has them. 700+ listings is no joke. Fees are low. The trading bots are actually useful and free. For a certain type of trader - someone who knows what they're doing and wants early access to projects - it's hard to beat.</p>

        <h5>The not-so-good stuff</h5>
        <p>They got hacked for $285M. They're based in Seychelles, which means basically no oversight. Customer support is slow when things get busy. The interface takes getting used to. If you're American, you're technically not supposed to be there. These aren't small issues.</p>

        <h5>How it stacks up</h5>
        <p>More coins than Binance (700 vs 350), but Binance is bigger and more liquid. Cheaper than Kraken, but Kraken has never been hacked and is actually regulated. Cheaper than Coinbase, but Coinbase is dead simple and legal everywhere. Different tools for different jobs.</p>

        <h5>Who it's for</h5>
        <p>Non-US traders who want altcoins, don't mind offshore risk, and won't keep large amounts on the exchange. If that's you, KuCoin works well. If you're in the US, paranoid about security, or new to crypto - this isn't your exchange.</p>

        <h5>Final thought</h5>
        <p>4.0/5. Great for altcoin hunters. The 2020 hack and offshore status keep it from scoring higher. Don't store your life savings there, but as a place to trade obscure coins? It does the job.</p>
