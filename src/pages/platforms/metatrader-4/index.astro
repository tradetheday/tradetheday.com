  {
    question: 'What is MetaTrader 4?',
    answer: 'MetaTrader 4 (MT4) is the world\'s most popular forex trading platform, developed by MetaQuotes Software in 2005. It offers advanced charting, technical analysis tools, automated trading via Expert Advisors (EAs), and is available on desktop, web, and mobile devices. MT4 is not a broker – it\'s a third-party platform that brokers license to provide trading access to their clients.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Who owns MetaTrader 4?',
    answer: 'MetaTrader 4 is owned by MetaQuotes Software Corp, the company that developed it. Brokers pay a licensing fee (around $100,000 upfront plus $15,000+ monthly) to offer MT4 to their clients. MetaQuotes provides the server infrastructure while brokers control the trading conditions.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is MetaTrader 4 a broker?',
    answer: 'No, MT4 is not a broker. It\'s a trading platform that brokers use to connect traders to the markets. Brokers that primarily use MetaTrader are often called "MetaTrader Brokers". You need to open an account with a broker to use MT4 for live trading.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which broker has the best MT4?',
    answer: `For ${currentYear}, AvaTrade offers one of the best MT4 experiences with multi-regulation (FCA, ASIC, CySEC), competitive spreads from 0.9 pips, and excellent EA support. Axi is ideal for ECN trading with raw spreads from 0.0 pips on MT4.`
  },
  {
    question: 'Is MT4 free to use?',
    answer: 'Yes, MT4 is completely free to download and use. You get the platform for free when you open an account with any MT4 broker. There are no platform fees – brokers make money from spreads and commissions on your trades, not from the platform itself.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use MT4 on Mac?',
    answer: 'Yes, MT4 works on Mac. Most brokers offer either a native Mac version or recommend using Wine/PlayOnMac. You can also use MT4 WebTrader which runs in any browser without installation, or the MT4 mobile app on iPhone.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is an Expert Advisor (EA)?',
    answer: 'An Expert Advisor (EA) is an automated trading program that runs on MT4. EAs can analyze markets, generate signals, and execute trades automatically based on pre-programmed rules. You can create your own EAs using MQL4 programming language, download free ones from the community, or purchase premium EAs from the MT4 marketplace.'
  },
  {
    question: 'MT4 vs MT5 – which is better?',
    answer: 'MT4 is better for forex-focused trading and has wider EA compatibility with a larger community. MT5 offers more timeframes (21 vs 9), a built-in economic calendar, depth of market, and supports more asset classes including stocks. Most forex traders still prefer MT4 for its simplicity and established EA ecosystem, but MT5 is gaining ground.'
  },
  {
    question: 'My MT4 is displaying an "Invalid Account" error',
    answer: 'This usually means incorrect login details. Double-check your account number, password, and server selection. Make sure you\'re using the correct server (demo vs live). If you\'ve forgotten your password, check your registration email or contact your broker\'s support team.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What time does MetaTrader 4 display?',
    answer: 'MT4 displays the broker\'s server time, which varies by broker. Most brokers use GMT+2 or GMT+3 (depending on daylight saving). This server time determines when daily candles open and close. You can check your broker\'s server time in the Market Watch window.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I change my MT4 password?',
    answer: 'Go to Tools → Options → Server tab. Click "Change" next to the password field. You\'ll need your current password to set a new one. For security, use a strong password and don\'t share it with anyone.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I run multiple MT4 instances?',
    answer: 'Yes, you can run multiple MT4 instances on the same computer. Install MT4 to different folders (e.g., MT4_Broker1, MT4_Broker2) and you can run them simultaneously. This is useful for trading with multiple brokers or managing different strategies.'

          <h2 class="heading-2">What is MetaTrader 4?</h2>
          <p>
            MetaTrader 4 (MT4) is the world's most widely used retail forex trading platform. Developed by MetaQuotes Software and released in 2005, it has become the industry standard for forex and CFD trading with over 16 million traders worldwide.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simply put, MetaTrader 4 is a trading platform that provides retail traders leverage and access to a wide array of tools for trading. With these tools, you can build and develop a sophisticated trading algorithm, or simply use the platform for day-trading financial instruments offered by your broker.
          </p>
          <p>
            MT4 is popular because it combines powerful charting tools, technical analysis capabilities, and automated trading through Expert Advisors (EAs) in one user-friendly package. It's available for free through any MT4-supporting broker.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> MetaTrader 4 is not owned by a brokerage, nor is MT4 a broker. It's a third-party platform that brokers license to allow trading. Brokers pay MetaQuotes to use the software, which allows their systems to trade via the platform.
          </p>

          <h3>MetaTrader 4 Summary</h3>
          <p>
            Traders love MT4. It's been around since the very beginning of retail trading, and for that reason, it has a huge following. There are a large number of addons, customisations and Trading Robots, known on MT4 as "Expert Advisors" (EAs).
          </p>
          <p>
            There's the ability to add trading signals and more, all specifically built for MT4. These addons are cross-compatible with MT5, but MT5 doesn't offer a great deal different, so many traders have decided to stick with what they know, which has kept MT4 as the popular choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Development and support will eventually end on MT4 and MetaQuotes will force brokers and users to make the switch to MT5, in most cases reluctantly. However, for now, MT4 remains the dominant platform.

      <div class="criteria-grid">
        <div class="criteria-card">
          <span class="criteria-number">1</span>
          <h3>Regulation</h3>
          <p>Choose brokers regulated by tier-1 authorities like FCA (UK), ASIC (Australia), or CySEC (EU). This ensures fund protection and fair practices.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="criteria-card">
          <span class="criteria-number">2</span>
          <h3>Spreads & Fees</h3>
          <p>Compare spreads on major pairs like EUR/USD. ECN brokers offer raw spreads from 0.0 pips but charge commission. Standard accounts have wider spreads but no commission.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="criteria-card">
          <span class="criteria-number">3</span>
          <h3>Execution Speed</h3>
          <p>For scalping and EA trading, execution speed matters. Look for brokers with servers close to your location and low latency.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="criteria-card">
          <span class="criteria-number">4</span>
          <h3>EA Policy</h3>
          <p>Not all brokers allow all EAs. Check if your broker permits scalping EAs, news trading, and high-frequency strategies.</p>
