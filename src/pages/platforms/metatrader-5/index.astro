  {
    question: 'What is MetaTrader 5?',
    answer: 'MetaTrader 5 (MT5) is a multi-asset trading platform developed by MetaQuotes Software, released in 2010 as the successor to MT4. Unlike MT4 which focuses on forex, MT5 supports trading stocks, futures, commodities, and forex from a single platform. It features 21 timeframes, 38 technical indicators, a built-in economic calendar, and the more powerful MQL5 programming language.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Who owns MetaTrader 5?',
    answer: 'MetaTrader 5 is owned by MetaQuotes Software Corp, the same company that developed MT4. MetaQuotes is actively promoting MT5 as their flagship platform and has stopped licensing MT4 to new brokers. Brokers pay licensing fees to offer MT5 to their clients.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is MT5 better than MT4?',
    answer: 'MT5 has more features: 21 timeframes (vs 9), built-in economic calendar, full Depth of Market, more indicators (38 vs 30), and multi-asset support. However, MT4 has a much larger EA library and better backward compatibility. Choose MT5 if you want multi-asset trading or need more timeframes; stick with MT4 if you rely on existing EAs or only trade forex.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which broker is best for MT5?',
    answer: `For ${currentYear}, AvaTrade offers excellent MT5 support with multi-regulation (FCA, ASIC, CySEC), competitive spreads from 0.9 pips, and access to 1,250+ instruments including stocks via MT5. Axi provides MT5 with raw ECN spreads from 0.0 pips for advanced traders.`
  },
  {
    question: 'Is MT5 free to use?',
    answer: 'Yes, MT5 is completely free to download and use. Brokers provide the platform at no cost when you open an account. There are no subscription fees or platform charges. Brokers make money from spreads and commissions on your trades, not from the platform itself.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use MT4 EAs on MT5?',
    answer: 'No, MT4 Expert Advisors (EAs) are NOT compatible with MT5. MT4 uses MQL4 programming language while MT5 uses MQL5 - they are completely different. EAs must be rewritten from scratch for MT5. This is the main reason many traders still prefer MT4.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I trade stocks on MT5?',
    answer: 'Yes, MT5 supports stock trading - this is one of its key advantages over MT4. However, stock availability depends on your broker. AvaTrade and IC Markets offer stock CFDs through MT5. For direct stock exchange access, you\'ll need a broker that offers exchange trading via MT5.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is Depth of Market (DOM)?',
    answer: 'Depth of Market shows the live order book - all pending buy and sell orders at different price levels. This helps traders see where liquidity exists and make better entry/exit decisions. MT5\'s DOM is more advanced than MT4\'s limited version, showing full order book data.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Does MT5 have copy trading?',
    answer: 'Yes, MT5 has a built-in Signals service that allows you to subscribe to and automatically copy other traders. The Signals tab in the Toolbox shows available providers with their track records. Some brokers like AvaTrade also offer additional copy trading integrations.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between hedging and netting?',
    answer: 'Hedging mode allows multiple positions on the same symbol (you can have both buy and sell positions simultaneously). Netting mode combines all positions into a single net position per symbol. MT5 supports both; MT4 only supports hedging. Forex traders typically prefer hedging mode.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use MT5 on Mac?',
    answer: 'Yes, MT5 works on Mac. You can use MT5 Web (browser-based, no installation needed), download the official Mac version from MetaQuotes (runs via Wine/CrossOver), or use the MT5 mobile app on iPhone. Most brokers provide Mac installation guides.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I backtest strategies on MT5?',
    answer: 'MT5\'s Strategy Tester is more powerful than MT4\'s. Access it via View → Strategy Tester or Ctrl+R. MT5 uses multi-threaded testing (faster), supports multiple symbols, and offers more accurate tick-by-tick simulation. You can optimize EA parameters and run forward testing.'

          <h2 class="heading-2">What is MetaTrader 5?</h2>
          <p>
            MetaTrader 5 (MT5) is a multi-asset trading platform developed by MetaQuotes Software and released in 2010. While MT4 focused primarily on forex trading, MT5 was designed from the ground up to support multiple asset classes including stocks, futures, commodities, and forex.
          </p>
          <p>
            MT5 is not just an upgrade to MT4 - it's a completely different platform with a new programming language (MQL5), more timeframes (21 vs 9), an integrated economic calendar, and full Depth of Market functionality. These features make it the preferred choice for traders who want multi-asset exposure from a single platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite being released in 2010, MT5 only gained significant traction in recent years as MetaQuotes stopped licensing MT4 to new brokers. This means all new brokers must offer MT5, and existing brokers are being encouraged to migrate their clients to MT5.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> MetaTrader 5 is not a broker - it's a trading platform that brokers license from MetaQuotes. Your broker provides the trading conditions (spreads, leverage, instruments) while MT5 provides the interface and execution technology.
          </p>

          <h3>MT5 vs MT4: The Key Differences</h3>
          <p>
            The biggest differences between MT5 and MT4 are: more timeframes (21 vs 9), a built-in economic calendar (MT4 has none), full Depth of Market, support for exchange trading (stocks, futures), and the MQL5 programming language which is more powerful but not backward compatible with MT4's MQL4.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many traders still use MT4 because their existing Expert Advisors (EAs) don't work on MT5 without being completely rewritten. However, for new traders starting fresh or those wanting to trade multiple asset classes, MT5 is the better choice.

            <p>One of MT5's biggest advantages over MT4 is the integrated economic calendar. This shows upcoming economic events, their expected impact, previous readings, and forecasts - all without leaving the platform.</p>
            <p>You can filter events by country, impact level (high, medium, low), and date range. Events are displayed in real-time with automatic updates as data is released.</p>
            <p>For fundamental traders, this eliminates the need for external websites like Forex Factory or Investing.com - everything you need is built into MT5.</p>
            <div class="broker-note">
              <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use the calendar to avoid trading during high-impact news events, or strategically trade the volatility around major releases.

            <p>MT5 uses MQL5, an object-oriented programming language more powerful than MT4's MQL4. MQL5 enables more sophisticated trading algorithms with better performance and more capabilities.</p>

          <span class="criteria-number">1</span>
          <h3>Regulation</h3>
          <p>Choose brokers regulated by tier-1 authorities like FCA (UK), ASIC (Australia), or CySEC (EU). This ensures fund protection, segregated accounts, and fair practices.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="criteria-card">
          <span class="criteria-number">2</span>
          <h3>Asset Coverage</h3>
          <p>If you want multi-asset trading (MT5's main advantage), check what instruments the broker offers on MT5. Some only offer forex; others provide stocks, futures, and more.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="criteria-card">
          <span class="criteria-number">3</span>
          <h3>Spreads & Fees</h3>
          <p>Compare spreads on major pairs. ECN accounts offer raw spreads from 0.0 pips but charge commission. Standard accounts have wider spreads but no commission.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="criteria-card">
          <span class="criteria-number">4</span>
          <h3>Execution Quality</h3>
          <p>For scalping and EA trading, execution speed matters. Look for brokers with low latency, minimal slippage, and servers close to major financial centers.</p>
