  'Built-in cTrader Copy lets you follow and copy successful traders without third-party plugins',

  {
    question: 'What is cTrader?',
    answer: 'cTrader is a professional forex and CFD trading platform developed by Spotware Systems. Launched in 2011, it\'s designed specifically for ECN/STP trading with features like Level II pricing (full depth of market), built-in copy trading, and algorithmic trading via cTrader Automate. It\'s available on desktop, web, and mobile.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is cTrader better than MT4?',
    answer: 'cTrader has advantages for certain traders: better depth of market visibility, more intuitive modern interface, 26 timeframes vs MT4\'s 9, built-in copy trading, and native ECN execution. However, MT4 has a larger community, more third-party EAs and indicators, and wider broker support. Choose cTrader if you prioritize transparent ECN pricing and modern features.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is cTrader free?',
    answer: 'Yes, cTrader is completely free. When you open an account with a cTrader broker, you get full access to the platform at no cost. Brokers make money from spreads and commissions on your trades, not from platform fees.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is cTrader Copy?',
    answer: 'cTrader Copy is the built-in social trading feature that lets you automatically copy trades from successful strategy providers. You can browse providers by performance statistics, set your risk parameters, and diversify across multiple providers. Unlike third-party copy trading, it\'s fully integrated into the platform.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is cTrader Automate (cAlgo)?',
    answer: 'cTrader Automate (formerly cAlgo) is cTrader\'s algorithmic trading environment. It uses C# programming language to create custom indicators and automated trading robots called cBots. C# gives access to the full .NET framework, making it more powerful than MT4\'s MQL4, though with a steeper learning curve.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which broker has the best cTrader?',
    answer: `For ${currentYear}, Pepperstone and IC Markets offer the best cTrader experience. Both provide raw ECN spreads from 0.0 pips, fast execution, tier-1 regulation (FCA/ASIC), and full support for cTrader Copy and Automate features.`
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use Expert Advisors (EAs) on cTrader?',
    answer: 'cTrader uses cBots instead of EAs. While MT4 EAs won\'t work directly on cTrader, cBots serve the same purpose - automated trading. cBots are written in C# rather than MQL4. There are conversion services available, but it\'s generally better to find or create native cBots.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is Level II pricing?',
    answer: 'Level II pricing (Depth of Market or DOM) shows you the full order book - all the buy and sell orders at different price levels, not just the best bid/ask. This lets you see real liquidity, identify support/resistance levels, and understand market depth. cTrader displays this clearly in its DOM panel.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use cTrader on Mac?',
    answer: 'Yes, cTrader works on Mac through cTrader Web, which runs in any browser without installation. There\'s also a native Mac version available from some brokers. The web platform has nearly identical functionality to desktop.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is cTrader good for scalping?',
    answer: 'Yes, cTrader is excellent for scalping. The combination of Level II pricing, quick trade execution with one-click trading, 26 timeframes (including tick charts), and no dealing desk intervention makes it ideal for scalpers. The platform was specifically designed for fast-paced ECN trading.'

          <h2 class="heading-2">What is cTrader?</h2>
          <p>
            cTrader is a professional-grade forex and CFD trading platform developed by Spotware Systems. Launched in 2011, it was built from the ground up for ECN/STP trading - meaning direct market access with no dealing desk intervention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike MetaTrader 4 which was originally designed for market makers, cTrader was created specifically for traders who want transparent pricing. You see real market depth with Level II pricing, get true interbank spreads, and experience fast execution without requotes.
          </p>
          <p>
            cTrader includes features that MT4 requires third-party plugins for: built-in copy trading (cTrader Copy), algorithmic trading environment (cTrader Automate), and a fully-featured web platform that runs in any browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            The platform is available for desktop (Windows and Mac), web browser, and mobile devices (iOS and Android). All versions share the same modern interface and feature set, so you can trade seamlessly across devices.
          </p>

          <h3>cTrader Summary</h3>
          <p>
            cTrader is the platform of choice for serious traders who prioritize execution quality and market transparency. The Level II pricing shows you exactly where the liquidity is, the modern interface feels intuitive from day one, and features like one-click trading speed up your workflow.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main trade-off compared to MT4 is ecosystem size. While cTrader has a growing community of cBot developers and signal providers, it can't match MT4's massive library of Expert Advisors and indicators built over 18+ years. However, for traders who want ECN execution and modern features, cTrader is hard to beat.

          </summary>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Level II pricing is one of cTrader's standout features. Unlike basic bid/ask quotes, Level II shows you the full order book - all pending buy and sell orders at different price levels.</p>
            <p>This transparency helps you understand real market liquidity, see where large orders are sitting, and identify potential support and resistance levels based on actual order flow.</p>
            <p>The DOM (Depth of Market) panel in cTrader displays this visually, showing order sizes at each price level. You can trade directly from the DOM by clicking price levels to place orders.</p>
            <div class="broker-note">
              <strong>Why it matters:</strong> With Level II, you're seeing the same information that institutional traders see. No more guessing about liquidity or market depth.

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>cTrader Copy is the built-in social trading system that lets you automatically replicate trades from successful strategy providers. It's fully integrated into the platform - no third-party plugins required.</p>
            <p>As a copier, you can browse strategy providers, view their detailed performance statistics (win rate, drawdown, profit factor), and allocate funds to copy their trades automatically. You control your risk with equity-based position sizing.</p>
            <p>As a strategy provider, you can share your trading strategies and earn commissions when others copy you. cTrader handles all the tracking and attribution automatically.</p>

          </summary>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>cTrader Automate (formerly known as cAlgo) is the algorithmic trading environment that lets you create custom indicators and automated trading robots (cBots).</p>
            <p>Unlike MT4's MQL4, cTrader Automate uses C# - a powerful, modern programming language. This gives you access to the full .NET framework, meaning you can integrate with databases, web APIs, and other systems that would be difficult in MQL4.</p>
            <p>cTrader includes a built-in code editor with IntelliSense, debugging tools, and backtesting capabilities. You can also download pre-built cBots from the cTrader community.</p>
            <p><strong>Key capabilities:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create custom indicators and cBots using C#</li>
              <li>Full .NET framework access for advanced integrations</li>
              <li>Built-in backtester with optimization</li>
              <li>Access to market data, account info, and order management APIs</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="broker-note">
              <strong>Learning curve:</strong> If you know any C-style language (C#, Java, JavaScript), you'll pick up cBot development quickly. The <a href="https://ctrader.com/ctrader-automate/guides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official cTrader Automate documentation</a> is excellent.

        <div class="criteria-card">
          <span class="criteria-number">4</span>
